This is just a simple template (or maybe better to call an example) of a Master/PhD thesis. The template is made based on the template taken from Department of Precision Engineering, Graduate School of Engineering, The University of Tokyo, but should be adaptable to match requirements by any department/university.

Mainly this is designed for making the title page in Japanese, but the rest of the content is in English. \texttt{platex} from W32TeX or TeXLive is needed. Please find the installation guide (mostly in Japanese) to install one of these packages (easier in Linux.) If Japanese is not required , changing all the texts in the title page and you can use normal \LaTeX\ to compile.
